            The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an
            intergovernmental organisation that supports countries in their
            transition to a sustainable energy future, and serves as the
            principal platform for international cooperation, a centre of
            excellence, and a repository of policy, technology, resource and
            financial knowledge on renewable energy. IRENA promotes the
            widespread adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable
            energy, including bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean, solar
            and wind energy in the pursuit of sustainable development, energy
            access, energy security and low-carbon economic growth and
            prosperity.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a mandate from countries around the world, IRENA encourages
            governments to adopt enabling policies for renewable energy
            investments, provides practical tools and policy advice to
            accelerate renewable energy deployment, and facilitates knowledge
            sharing and technology transfer to provide clean, sustainable energy
            for the worldâ€™s growing population.
          </p>
          <p>
            In line with these aims, IRENA provides a wide range of products and
            services, including:
